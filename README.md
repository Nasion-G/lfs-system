# lfs-system
This is the repository where I am hosting my own Linux from Scratch system. 
It is quite minimal, only about 1 GiB uncompressed, but even so, it is a fully functioning system with everything you would like to use. It is a 64-bit system and the bootloader is using BIOS (not UEFI). 
I spent around 10 days to make it from start to finish, and I am quite happy with my work. I look forward to adding a Desktop Enviroment to it in the very near future.
